        by Diego Torres
        - Added more documentation and some info on errors
        when compiling cross-platform.

        - Support UTF8 characters, using iconv
        (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv), and
        force case-insensitivenes.
        - Added debuging output to a temporary file
        - Support for x86_64 and 32bits architecture
        - Provided make.sh, documentation and examples

        - Tomas' bug (damlevlim("h","hello",2) i get 4)
        Adapted from Josh Drew's levenshtein code using pseudo
        code from
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau–Levenshtein_distance
        - an optimal string alignment algorithm, as opposed to
        'edit distance' as per the notes in the wp article

        Levenshtein Distance Algorithm implementation as MySQL UDF
        by Joshua Drew for SpinWeb Net Designs, Inc. on 2003-12-28.

Derived
        The levenshtein function is derived from the C implementation
        by Lorenzo Seidenari. More information about the Levenshtein
        Distance Algorithm can be found at http://www.merriampark.com/ld.htm

Redistribute as you wish, but leave this information intact.

Compiling
        Run make.sh (adjust paths of mysql include files and mysqlclient library)
        No makefile, neither needed. It will generate both 32 and x86_64 versions.
        There are lots of debug outputs. Enable them by defining the DEBUG symbol.

        If you get this error when compiling:

        /usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: fatal error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or director

        You're missing the 32 bit libc dev package. This is answered here:

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7412548/gnu-stubs-32-h-no-such-file-or-directory

        On Ubuntu it's called libc6-dev-i386 - do sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386. See below for extra instructions for Ubuntu 12.04.
        On Red Hat distros, the package name is glibc-devel.i686 (Thanks to David Gardner's comment)
        On CentOS 5.8, the package name is glibc-devel.i386 (Thanks to JimKleck's comment)
        On CentOS 6.3, the package name is glibc-devel.i686.
        On SLES it's called glibc-devel-32bit - do zypper in glibc-devel-32bit

Loading UDFs in MySQL STEP 1
    Copy compiled udf to plugin dir. To know where exactly, ask MySQL:

        mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'plugin_dir';

    and use result directory.

    To modify plugin_dir to point to a custom location:

        my.cnf: plugin_dir = /usr/lib/mysql/plugin

    Don't forget to restart MySQL!!

Loading UDFs in MySQL STEP 2

    Bind the library to an UDF inside MySQL (only do it once, 
    survives MySQL reboot). Depending your MySQL binaries (32 
    or 64 bits), insert the right library.

        mysql> DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS mysql.damlevlim256u;

        mysql> CREATE FUNCTION damlevlim256u RETURNS INT SONAME 'mysqldamlevlim256u32.so';

        or

        mysql> CREATE FUNCTION damlevlim256u RETURNS INT SONAME 'mysqldamlevlim256u64.so';

    Check:

        mysql> SELECT * FROM mysql.func;
        +---------------+-----+-------------------------+----------+
        | name          | ret | dl                      | type     |
        +---------------+-----+-------------------------+----------+
        | damlevlim256u |   2 | mysqldamlevlim256u32.so | function |
        +---------------+-----+-------------------------+----------+
        1 row in set (0.00 sec)


Using damlevlim256u

        mysql> select damlevlim256u();
        ERROR: DAMLEVLIM() requires three arguments (string, string, int)

        First string is compared against second string. Compare only the first
        int chars (upper bound).

        mysql> select damlevlim256u('coche', 'çóche', 5);
        +--------------------------------------+
        | damlevlim256u('coche', 'çòche', 5) |
        +--------------------------------------+
        |                                    0 |
        +--------------------------------------+
        1 row in set (0.00 sec)

How to search for multibyte characters in a column:
    Use MySql CHAR_LENGTH function to find rows with multi-byte characters:
        mysql> SELECT name FROM users WHERE LENGTH(name) != CHAR_LENGTH(name);

How to search for strange multibyte characters in a column 
    (don't remember source of original tip)
    Use MySql HEX and PHP bin2hex functions

        mysql> SELECT name, HEX(name) FROM users;

    Get the result back into PHP, and run a bin2hex on the string, compare it to MySQL’s hex of that same string
